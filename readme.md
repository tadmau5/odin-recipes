Hello World!

Welcome to my first project within TheOdinProject program. I will be using the skills I have learned to create a website for recipes.

Once the project is completed, I will have demonstrated skill in creating html boilerplates, adding and manipulating multiple elements on each page, linking to other pages within the website, adding jpg images, and adding properly formatted commit messages.
