        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Sometimes two beers are better than one. Well, actually, two beers are <em>always</em> better than one. Try your hand at making this fun and delicious combination of both dark and light beers. Your first try may not look perfect, but at least it still tastes great!</p>
            <p>The secret here lies in the densities of the two beers. One <em>floats</em> on top of the other! For that reason, the two beers you choose will be very important. My favorites are Guinness stout and Bass pale ale.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>6</strong> Guinness stout beers</li>
                <li><strong>6</strong> Bass pale ale beers</li>
                <li>Large metal spoon</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a pint glass halfway with the pale ale.</li>
                <li>Float the Guinness on top by slowly pouring it over the back of a spoon to fill the glass.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
